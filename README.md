#  Bookmark Buddy  

### Built with an AI Agent, Refined by a Human

A web-based application that allows users to upload their Chrome/Safari bookmark HTML files, parses them, and displays a clean, interactive dashboard to explore and manage bookmarks easily.

## Features

- Upload bookmarks via `.html` file exported from Chrome or Safari
- Parses and analyzes the bookmark structure (folders, links, metadata)
- Displays a visual dashboard for easy navigation
- Enables better organization and overview of saved content


## How to Use

1. Open the web app in your browser (on Replit or locally)
2. Click **Upload Bookmarks**
3. Select your `bookmarks.html` file
4. Click **Analyze Bookmarks**
5. Visualize and organize your bookmark collection 


## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookmark-organizer.git
cd bookmark-organizer
npm install
npm dev run
```

## Notes

* Hands-on exercise on using AI-Agent to build a web app from scratch
* Developed this in ~2 hours using Replit and added additional fixes using GitHub Copilot
* Focused on user simplicity and clean visualization
* The core functionality (uploading a bookmark HTML file and visualizing its contents) is implemented
* However, the current codebase is not production-ready and requires additional fixes
* Manual debugging and rewrites were necessary showing that AI-generated code often still requires human intervention for correctness and edge-case handling.
